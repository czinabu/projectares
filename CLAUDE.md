# Project Ares: notes for AI sessions

Full-loot PvPvE extraction game in Godot 4 (GDScript). See README.md for the
layout and how to play. The roadmap is: Phase 0 bot-only prototype (done),
Phase 1 vertical slice (hub, loadouts, abilities, motorbike), Phase 2 online
PvPvE on a dedicated server, Phase 3 full Ashfront, Phase 4 a second world.

## Rules that must not be broken

- `core/` never references a specific world. Anything world-specific goes
  through `WorldDef` (`core/world/world_def.gd`). If a world needs something
  the contract lacks, extend the contract.
- Actors are driven only through `ActorCommand`. Never read `Input` inside
  `Actor`, weapons, or anything else that must run on a server. Input lives in
  `core/player/player_controller.gd`.
- All damage goes through `Combat.deal`. Never call `HealthComponent.apply_damage`
  directly for gameplay damage, or world PvP rules are bypassed.
- Shots and melee originate from the actor (eyes, body), never from the camera.
- The camera never changes view on its own. First/third-person switches only
  when the player presses the toggle (playtest feedback). The one exception:
  getting on a vehicle uses a separate riding view (third-person by default),
  and getting off restores the on-foot view.
- `Raid` has no camera, HUD, or input code. It must keep working headless.
- Blocking and parrying happen in `Weapon.modify_incoming`, which `Combat.deal`
  calls for every hit. Every melee attack keeps a visible windup so it can be parried.
- Melee is directional. The stance travels in `ActorCommand.stance`, attacks
  set `DamageInfo.direction`, and `MeleeWeapon.guard_covers` decides whether a
  guard stops a hit. Windup and guard poses must show their side.
- Sound and visual effects (`Sfx`, `Fx`) must stay no-ops on a headless server.
- Art lives in the `Look` autoload (`core/visual/`), not in gameplay scripts.
  Gameplay scripts keep building plain greybox shapes; `Look` dresses them
  when they enter the tree and does nothing when headless. It never adds
  collision or changes the simulation, and it never names a world: worlds
  pick surfaces, an atmosphere and bot skins (`set_meta("look", ...)`) from
  its generic kits. Decoration in a map uses its own RNG so it cannot shift
  the gameplay layout.
- People are built from parts (`core/visual/human.gd`): an "appearance" names
  a build, four parts and colours. It is cosmetic only and never trusted:
  always pass one through `Look.clean_appearance` / `Look.set_appearance`,
  which is safe on a headless server. Online it travels in the spawn data as
  `data["look"]`; the server keeps what each signed-in player sent
  (`NetSession.look_for_peer`). `Raid` and gameplay never read it.
  Players may only wear `Human.STARTER` clothes plus outfits they own:
  `Human.player_look(raw, owned)` enforces it on the profile, in the
  customizer and on the server. Better outfits are bought or earned, never
  added to the starter list. Bots use `Human.sanitize` and can wear anything.
- Only CC0 or similarly permissive assets, each recorded in `assets/LICENSES.md`.
- Load assets that need importing (models, textures, fonts) with `load()` at
  runtime, not `preload`: a preload fails to parse on a fresh checkout before
  Godot has imported the file.
- Items are ids defined in `ItemDB` with tags. Use tags, not id checks, to
  decide what an item does.
- Gear behavior comes from the item's `stats` in `ItemDB`, applied by
  `Loadout.equip`. Add a new gun or frame as data, not as a new class.
- Flight rigs and abilities are data too. `FlightRig` and `Ability` are single
  classes whose item stats pick the behavior. Abilities fire from
  `ActorCommand.ability_pressed`.
- Vehicles are items tagged `vehicle`, tuned by their stats, and spawned by
  `Raid` (never carried). `core/vehicle/vehicle.gd` reads its rider's
  `ActorCommand` and moves the rider; `Actor` skips its own movement while
  `Actor.vehicle` is set. The script has no `class_name`; preload it.
- Mastery (`core/progression/`) is keyed by gear type tags ("rifle", "blink",
  "frame_heavy"), never by item id. Variants are sidegrades: every one trades a
  strength for a weakness, and death never takes mastery away. Variant picks go
  into `Raid.start` alongside the kit; `Raid` never reads them from `Profile`.
- `starter`-tagged items are the free scrap kit. They never enter the stash.
- `Raid` never touches `Profile` to build a kit. The kit is passed into
  `Raid.start`, so a server can supply it later.

- Online play: the server is the authority (`Raid.Mode.SERVER`, `NetSession`).
  Clients simulate actors from commands for responsiveness, but
  `Combat.authoritative` is false there, so a client never deals damage, loots,
  or decides an outcome. Anything that changes a result must run on the server
  and reach clients through `NetSession`.
- Online movement: a client numbers every input and sends the last few in
  each packet; the server plays them in order, one per tick, and each state
  entry carries the input number it had reached. The client corrects its own
  actor by comparing the server's position with its remembered prediction for
  that input (`NetSession._history`), never with its current position, and
  blends every correction over several ticks. Keep `Actor` movement
  deterministic from its `ActorCommand` so prediction keeps matching.
- Lag compensation: each input also carries the server tick the client's view
  had reached, and the server keeps half a second of past positions. Attacks
  judge targets at `Combat.positions_seen_by(attacker)` (shots via
  `Combat.trace`), never by reading other actors' `global_position` directly,
  so a lagging player hits what was on their screen. A vehicle the local
  player rides is predicted and corrected against `NetSession._ride_history`
  like the player's own actor.
- Online, the server owns each player's stash, loadout and mastery
  (`core/account/stash_service.gd`). A client's kit or picks are never trusted;
  the server gets them from `StashService.deploy` and applies results with
  `StashService.settle`. `NetSession` does both. A client only signs in
  (name plus `Profile.online_secret`) and sends requests (equip, pick, deploy)
  from the lobby; it never sends a kit, and online play never reads or writes
  the local `Profile` stash. The hub shows the server's account snapshot while
  in a lobby (`Hub.enter_lobby`). Stash rules live once, in `core/account/stash_rules.gd`,
  shared by `Profile` and the service.
- The phone (`core/phone/phone.gd`) is the game's menu and only a view. Online,
  presence, contacts, messages, invites and news live on the server in
  `SocialService` (`core/social/social_service.gd`), keyed by the account id
  the peer signed in with, never by anything the client claims. `NetSession`
  turns phone requests into service calls and pushes each affected player a
  fresh `social_state` snapshot. A feature that adds a new place a player can be
  (base, social hub) reports it with `NetSession._set_presence(peer, where)` and
  a name in `SocialService.PLACE_NAMES`. Settings live in
  `core/settings/game_settings.gd` (its own save file); a server never reads them.
- `Raid` never writes to `Profile` on a server. Results travel in the
  `player_finished` dictionary. Online the server settles them into the
  account; `Raid.apply_result` is only for the local solo profile.
- The home base (`core/base/`) is a view of a stash, never a second store.
  `HomeBase.show_gear(stash, loadout)` rebuilds the room from plain data, so
  it shows the local `Profile` solo and the server's account snapshot in a
  lobby. `core/base/base_layout.gd` decides what goes where from item tags.
  Using a display only emits `equip_requested`; `main.gd` applies it through
  `Profile` or `NetSession.equip`. Like `Raid`, `HomeBase` has no camera, HUD
  or input code, and its displays are greybox shapes that `Look` dresses
  (any node with the meta `display_item`).

## Conventions

- A helper used by a single script is an inner class of that script, not a new
  `class_name` file.
- New `class_name` scripts only resolve after Godot rescans the project. The
  `Boot` autoload (`core/boot.gd`) detects a stale class list, runs the import
  step and restarts once. Keep `Boot` first in the autoload list and free of
  any project class.
- Typed GDScript, tabs, `class_name` for anything reused. Tuning values are
  plain `var`s at the top of the class.
- Gameplay shapes are built in code and dressed by `Look`. Hand-built `.tscn`
  scenes are fine later; keep the map contract.
- Every gameplay feature gets checks in `tests/test_runner.gd`.
