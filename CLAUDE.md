# Project Ares: notes for AI sessions

Full-loot PvPvE extraction game in Godot 4 (GDScript). See README.md for the
layout and how to play. The roadmap is: Phase 0 bot-only prototype (done),
Phase 1 vertical slice (hub, loadouts, abilities, motorbike), Phase 2 online
PvPvE on a dedicated server, Phase 3 full Ashfront, Phase 4 a second world.

## Rules that must not be broken

- `core/` never references a specific world. Anything world-specific goes
  through `WorldDef` (`core/world/world_def.gd`). If a world needs something
  the contract lacks, extend the contract.
- Actors are driven only through `ActorCommand`. Never read `Input` inside
  `Actor`, weapons, or anything else that must run on a server. Input lives in
  `core/player/player_controller.gd`.
- All damage goes through `Combat.deal`. Never call `HealthComponent.apply_damage`
  directly for gameplay damage, or world PvP rules are bypassed.
- Shots and melee originate from the actor (eyes, body), never from the camera.
- The camera never changes view on its own. First/third-person switches only
  when the player presses the toggle (playtest feedback). The one exception:
  getting on a vehicle uses a separate riding view (third-person by default),
  and getting off restores the on-foot view.
- `Raid` has no camera, HUD, or input code. It must keep working headless.
- Blocking and parrying happen in `Weapon.modify_incoming`, which `Combat.deal`
  calls for every hit. Every melee attack keeps a visible windup so it can be parried.
- Melee is directional. The stance travels in `ActorCommand.stance`, attacks
  set `DamageInfo.direction`, and `MeleeWeapon.guard_covers` decides whether a
  guard stops a hit. Windup and guard poses must show their side.
- Sound and visual effects (`Sfx`, `Fx`) must stay no-ops on a headless server.
- Art lives in the `Look` autoload (`core/visual/`), not in gameplay scripts.
  Gameplay scripts keep building plain greybox shapes; `Look` dresses them
  when they enter the tree and does nothing when headless. It never adds
  collision or changes the simulation, and it never names a world: worlds
  pick surfaces, an atmosphere and bot skins (`set_meta("look", ...)`) from
  its generic kits. Decoration in a map uses its own RNG so it cannot shift
  the gameplay layout.
- Only CC0 or similarly permissive assets, each recorded in `assets/LICENSES.md`.
- Load assets that need importing (models, textures, fonts) with `load()` at
  runtime, not `preload`: a preload fails to parse on a fresh checkout before
  Godot has imported the file.
- Items are ids defined in `ItemDB` with tags. Use tags, not id checks, to
  decide what an item does.
- Gear behavior comes from the item's `stats` in `ItemDB`, applied by
  `Loadout.equip`. Add a new gun or frame as data, not as a new class.
- Flight rigs and abilities are data too. `FlightRig` and `Ability` are single
  classes whose item stats pick the behavior. Abilities fire from
  `ActorCommand.ability_pressed`.
- Vehicles are items tagged `vehicle`, tuned by their stats, and spawned by
  `Raid` (never carried). `core/vehicle/vehicle.gd` reads its rider's
  `ActorCommand` and moves the rider; `Actor` skips its own movement while
  `Actor.vehicle` is set. The script has no `class_name`; preload it.
- Mastery (`core/progression/`) is keyed by gear type tags ("rifle", "blink",
  "frame_heavy"), never by item id. Variants are sidegrades: every one trades a
  strength for a weakness, and death never takes mastery away. Variant picks go
  into `Raid.start` alongside the kit; `Raid` never reads them from `Profile`.
- `starter`-tagged items are the free scrap kit. They never enter the stash.
- `Raid` never touches `Profile` to build a kit. The kit is passed into
  `Raid.start`, so a server can supply it later.

- Online play: the server is the authority (`Raid.Mode.SERVER`, `NetSession`).
  Clients simulate actors from commands for responsiveness, but
  `Combat.authoritative` is false there, so a client never deals damage, loots,
  or decides an outcome. Anything that changes a result must run on the server
  and reach clients through `NetSession`.
- Online, the server owns each player's stash, loadout and mastery
  (`core/account/stash_service.gd`). A client's kit or picks are never trusted;
  the server gets them from `StashService.deploy` and applies results with
  `StashService.settle`. Stash rules live once, in `core/account/stash_rules.gd`,
  shared by `Profile` and the service.
- `Raid` never writes to `Profile` on a server. Results travel in the
  `player_finished` dictionary and the player's own game applies them with
  `Raid.apply_result`.

## Conventions

- A helper used by a single script is an inner class of that script, not a new
  `class_name` file.
- New `class_name` scripts only resolve after Godot rescans the project. The
  `Boot` autoload (`core/boot.gd`) detects a stale class list, runs the import
  step and restarts once. Keep `Boot` first in the autoload list and free of
  any project class.
- Typed GDScript, tabs, `class_name` for anything reused. Tuning values are
  plain `var`s at the top of the class.
- Gameplay shapes are built in code and dressed by `Look`. Hand-built `.tscn`
  scenes are fine later; keep the map contract.
- Every gameplay feature gets checks in `tests/test_runner.gd`.

## Verify before committing

The project targets Godot 4.7 (what Caleb runs, and what CI uses).

```
godot --headless --path . --import
godot --headless --path . res://tests/test_runner.tscn   # must exit 0
godot --headless --path . res://tests/test_runner.tscn -- --only online   # one group
```

To see it rendered (needs a display or xvfb):

```
godot --path . res://tests/visual_check.tscn -- /some/output/dir
```
